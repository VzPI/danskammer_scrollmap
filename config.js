A newly realized Danskammer would deliver a 4,033% increase in CO2e emissions, from 47 thousand to nearly 2 million tons/year. Based on its historical operation trend seen in the graph above, a precipitous decline is obvious across the past decade.  Simply put, the plant barely operates.  A new baseline plant operation would be exponentially more emitting than current operations.

While Danskammer reassures the public that its ash pits are 'fully monitored', there is scant information in the application regarding their mitigation and final cleanup.  As is well known, the plant was inundated by Hurricane Sandy, yet Danskammer elects to construct in the same location with the unconvincing assertion that new facilities will remain outside of the 100-year floodplain and account for NYSDEC 2017 sea level rise guidance.  Nowhere in the application is there even the mention of storm surge inundation from a signifcant weather event - highly likely across the next 30 years of rapid climate change.",

Three plants - the CPV Plant in Middletown, the Cricket Valley Plant in Dover and now the Danskammer proposal near Newburgh are not happenstance; they are strategically arranged at the nexus of four interstate pipelines: Algonquin, Iroquois, Millennium, and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline (all represented by the gray lines on map at right). The image above was captured from a 2011 Millennium Pipeline, LLC planning document.  While their 'Secondary Power Plant Development Area' hasn't panned out yet, the primary one certainly has.",

            description: 'FERC, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is the primary driver of both gas pipelines and the markets in which they operate. Even as they hand over operation of the markets to RTOs (Regional Transmission Organizations), FERC has ultimate jurisdiction.  In 2014, FERC established the <i>NCZ</i> (New Capacity Zone), what is referred today as the <i>G-J Locality</i>, covering all NYC 5 boroughs and northern territories to Hudson Valley. In the map at right, the grey-blue territory is the zone; the bright blue lines represent transmission lines within the zone.  The <i>G-J Locality</i> was hotly contested by New York State as it would, and indeed has, raised rates precipitously in <i>downstate</i> New York.  Not by accident, this is where fracked gas plants have proliferated simply because they can make huge profits via the inflated zone rate, just as Danskammer intends to do. All the while, actual demand for the generation capacity remains steady, even decreases year over year. The chart above, based on New York Independent System Operator (NYSIO) 2019 modeling for the <i>G-J Locality</i> (inclusive of the Indian Point Nuclear Plant 2020-21 closure) 2009 - 2039, hardly makes the case for expanded gas generation.<p>References:</p><p><a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2019-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/">NYSIO 2019 Load & Capacity Data - Gold Book</a></p>',

This will continue apace until NYSIO is able to complete the major high-voltage transmission upgrades in the constrained region.

            image: 'https://i.imgur.com/drjzMlu.png',
            description: 'Contrary to conventional wisdom, New York State has been ineffective at stopping the proliferation of gas infrastructure. Yes, the state did ban the actual practice of fracking in 2014, but not the transport nor intensive use of its byproduct.  Notwithstanding, the state is nothing if not aspirational on emission targeting. With the passage of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) as enforceable law in late 2019, the state just handed itself a potentially lethal tool in the fight to stop gas infrastructure.  The first test - fully under the new law - will be the Danskammer plant. Early signs suggest a critical agency - The New York State Department of Conservation (NYSDEC) - may choose a proactive stance.  First, it did not sign off on the application stipulations concerning energy planning objectives. Second, it has placed onto the project docket a comment letter with the decisive conclusion that Danskammer cannot meet energy planning objectives as outlined in its application. Alone is this going to stop Danskammer? Certainly not. Like all gas fights, this one will require inordinate public pressure and determined legal opposition. Some organizations that are leading the way on both counts are listed as follows, and noted on the map to the right.  The application itself is available for bulk download as noted below, as is the Public Service Commission project docket for Danskammer.
