            description: '<p>Situated on the western shore of the Hudson River 50 miles north of New York City lies a decrepit, barely operating, 20th century power plant - the Danskammer Plant. Tiger Infrastructure, a venture capital outfit with close ties to the far-right Trump agenda, intends to cobble together plant remnants, meld them with new turbines, a compressor, pipes and metering yards, bringing to life a 40-year, always-on frankensteinian fracked gas plant. But first a public test: Danskammer will be scrutinized under the newly minted Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://public-accountability.org/report/putting-the-scam-in-danskammer/">Putting the Scam in Danskammer</a></p>',

A newly realized Danskammer would deliver a 4,033% increase in CO2e emissions, from 47 thousand to nearly 2 million tons/year. Based on its historical operation trend, the intended sleight-of-hand is obvious: use a no-build scenario that reflects operations backdated to 2010, ignoring the operations reality of the last decade.

Throughout the past decade, pipeline companies have aggressively pushed long-term, intensive end uses for their Marcellus Shale product, the prize being baseline power plants that consume huge amounts of gas on a FIRM contract basis. Indeed, their plans have largely proven effective, straddling the state with a toxic, non-renewable commitment that is proving month by month to be increasingly untenable in an era of rapid climate change.  Three plants - the CPV Plant in Middletown, the Cricket Valley Plant in Dover and now the Danskammer proposal near Newburgh are not happenstance; that are strategically arranged at the nexus of four interstate pipelines: Algonquin, Iroquois, Millennium, and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline (represented as blue lines on map).',

Yes, Constitution Pipeline was blocked in 2016, but it has been brought back to life in 2019 by none other than FERC.  Certainly the 2014 fracking moratorium was a significant environmental achievement, but in aggregate the state only possesses 0.03% of US gas reserves.  New York was, is, and will be for the foreseeable future a 'client state' primarily of Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale gas. However, the state is nothing if not aspirational on emission targeting. With the passage of CLCPA as enforceable law in late 2019, the state was just handed a lethal tool in the fight to kill the Danskammer application while severely cutting short the meager life left in this 20th century Behemoth.  Like all fights, this one will require inordinate public pressure and determined legal opposition. Organizations that are leading the way on both counts are listed as follows, and noted on the map to the right.
